=========

CardCoach is a program written in Java that helps users calculate time in a manner specific to a Company's
time tracking system.

Its time calculations and inner workings are specific to the company. However, it is a good example of
writing a program with a GUI that uses the SWT toolkit.

Code is minimally commented and was originally within a Mercurial repo. This repo reflects the latest
code within the Mercurial one.
